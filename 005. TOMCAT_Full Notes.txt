TOMCAT
------------------
Types of application deployments
----------------------------------------------
1. Manual deployment 		----> We have to manually upload the jar or war file into the tomcat webserver ---- Least preferred
2. Automated deployment	-----> JENKINS ----- Most commonly preferred

=> Inorder to do the manual deployment we will use EC2 Instance (Server)
=> Inside the VM, we will install the tomcat webserver
=> The webserver which is used to do the deployments is known as tomcat webserver
=> Source Code ----> Maven Goals (Package) ----> war file ----> Deploy = Deployment Process
=> Commonly used webservers: Apache Tomcat, JBoss, WebLogic, WebSphere....

=> Tomcat is managed by Apache Organization. Tomcat is name of the server.
=> Tomcat is an open-source s/w and it is available for FREE
=> Tomcat server will run on port number 8080

Tomcat Folder Structure
------------------------------
1. BIN (Binaries)
=> It contains the files that are required to start and stop the tomcat server.
=> Linux OS ----> startup.sh (used to start the tomcat server), shutdown.sh (used to stop the tomcat server)
=> Windows OS ----> startup.bat (used to start the tomcat server), shutdown.bat (used to stop the tomcat server)

2. CONF (Configuration)
=> It container the configuration related files
=> server.xml ----> Is used to configure the tomcat port number
=> tomcat-users.xml ----> Is used to configure the tomcat users

3. LIB (Library)
=> It contains the libraries i.e jar files

4. LOGS 
=> It contains the server logs i.e execution details

5. TEMP (Temporary)
=> It contains the temporary data

6. WEBAPPS 
=> In this folder will keep the application war files.
=> Also known as Deployment folder.
=> We can keep the multiple war files in the webapps folder, but it is not recommended.

Note: To work with tomcat, we have to install java s/w also
